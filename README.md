This project is a 2D role-playing game (RPG) built using Java and the Swing library. It features a player character that can interact with various non-playable characters (NPCs), including dialogue systems, and combat mechanics with monsters like Green Slime. The game includes player movement, collision detection, dynamic dialogue, and state transitions between different game modes (play, pause, and dialogue).

The goal is to create a fully functional RPG with expandable features like inventory systems, NPC interactions, and various enemy types. This project showcases object-oriented programming principles and game development skills in Java.
